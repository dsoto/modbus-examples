# Modbus Examples

These are a list of minimal working examples that can help you get started reading data from (electric bicycle) components that implement the MODBUS protocol.

# Python Examples

- ASI-MWE.py shows a single register reading from an ASI controller
- ASI-more-detailed.py shows a single register reading with details about the byte responses and object types
- ASI-read-write.py shows a read and write example for an ASI controller

# Arduino Examples

Future work will add arduino sketches to read from MODBUS devices
